# php-Mysql-Form-Developement
 The script is a sample dynamic form; basically, you get a form containing 4 fields: First | Last | Email | Browse and you have the option to add or remove rows from the form.
The script will save the First | Last | Email fields data in the database (see attached sample - accounts.sql) and will also save the path for the uploaded file ( e.g. uploads/filename.jpg ) and in the same will upload your file to the server in the upload directory ( e.g. uploads )
